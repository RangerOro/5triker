# 5triker
### A Minecraft Paper plugin to handle moderation in your server!

**5triker** is a Minecraft Paper (version 1.21) plugin which can handle moderation in your server using **strikes**.
Strikes are something inmaterial that players may have in their server, based on **how much times and which rules have players broke.**
For example, in a Minecraft server, a player broke rule A which has a value of 1 strike --> the player who broke the rule may get punished with 1 strike.

You shall specify a maximum of strikes people can have and for how much time they will be banned after reaching the strike maximum.
(This isn't currently available as it does not feature a configuration file, which I'll soon add!)

Note that strikes are only issued when you run the specific command to punish a player, it is not automated!
